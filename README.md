## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used:

1. Python
2. Pandas → Data loading, cleaning, and transformation
3. Seaborn → Data visualization (heatmaps, count plots)
4. Matplotlib → Bar chart plotting
5. Jupyter Notebook → Interactive coding and analysis environment

## 🚀 Key Features:

1. Data Cleaning
   1. Removed duplicate records
   2. Handled missing values
   3. Converted release dates into proper datetime format
2. Data Transformation
   1. Extracted release year from dates
   2. Split “Duration” into numeric minutes and units
   3. Created filtered datasets based on multiple conditions (Category, Year, Country, Rating, Cast, etc.)
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   1. Category distribution: Movies vs TV Shows
   2. Yearly trends in content production
   3. Top 10 most frequent directors
   4. Country-specific content analysis
   5. Ratings distribution analysis
4. Visualizations
   1. Seaborn heatmap to visualize missing values
   2. Count plots for category comparison
   3. Bar charts for yearly content distribution

## 📊 Results & Insights:

1. Movies outnumber TV Shows on Netflix.
2. Identified peak years for content releases.
3. Found the top 10 most prolific directors in the dataset.
4. Analyzed content ratings to understand audience targeting.
